_Who we are at the core._

---

**Laniameda** (working name). Studio brand in active use.

---

## Type

AI-native creative studio — operating at the intersection of art, engineering, and emotional depth.

Not just a creative agency. Not just a dev shop. The boundary between builder and maker doesn't exist here.

---

## Stage

**Pre-seed.** Building the foundation:
- Core products shipped and growing
- Brand + audience being built in public
- First customers being identified
- Agent infrastructure running and evolving

---

## Founder

**Michael** — creator, engineer, founder. Based in Minsk (Europe/Minsk timezone).
- Active on X (Twitter) under personal brand
- Building in public
- Generative AI creator + AI engineer

---

## Origin

Started from a personal creative practice. Evolved into a studio when it became clear the tools, workflows, and systems being built had value beyond one person.

The name, the work, the aesthetic — all of it comes from a genuine obsession with craft, resonance, and building things that feel right.

---

## Core Differentiator

Most AI studios solve for volume. **We solve for resonance.**
Most AI agencies sell outputs. **We build systems that create lasting value.**

AI is the instrument. Craft is the standard. Feeling is the output.

---

## Art as Foundation

**We are artists first.** Not "creatives." Not "content creators." Artists.

Art isn't what we make — it's how we see. It's the thing inside that screams to be filled. The compulsion to create, to master, to push. This is what drives every decision, every frame, every line of code.

We are living in the renaissance era of creation. For 10–15 years, art was noise, money, metrics. Artists were misfits. Now it's a different era — anyone can make anything, which means **the only thing that matters is whether you're actually an artist**. Not the tool. Not the output. The vision behind it.

Few people make the film even though everyone can. That gap — between capability and compulsion — is where artists live. That's our people. That's our content. That's our brand.

This is not a content strategy. It's a worldview we build everything from.

---

## Core Mantras

- **Marketing First** — every product decision has a content angle
- **AI-native** — AI is the instrument, not the shortcut
- **Ship, then refine** — validate fast, compound over time
- **We make art** — not content, not output. Art.
