# Vision

_The north star. Updated when direction shifts._

---

## One-Line

Build the AI-native creative studio that defines what taste-driven, system-powered work looks like in this era.

---

## What We're Building Toward

A studio where:
- Every product ships with its own content engine
- Every workflow is automated without sacrificing quality
- AI is used as a creative amplifier, not a cost-cutter
- The work moves people — not just impresses them

---

## 12-Month Goals

1. **laniameda.gallery** — live, public, used by real AI creators worldwide
2. **Audience** — meaningful following on X + LinkedIn around AI creatorship
3. **Revenue signal** — first paying customers or strong inbound interest from clients
4. **Content engine** — consistent, high-quality output with minimal manual effort
5. **Agent system** — Lani/Meda/Persey running smoothly as a distributed org

---

## What We Are NOT Building (Phase 1)

- Generic AI tools for mass market
- High-volume content farms
- Anything that sacrifices taste for speed
- B2B SaaS before we've proven creative value

---

## The Longer Arc

Phase 1 → personal vault, personal brand, proving the model
Phase 2 → productize for other AI creators
Phase 3 → studio-as-platform: systems, talent, clients at scale

Don't let Phase 2 or 3 complexity creep into Phase 1.
