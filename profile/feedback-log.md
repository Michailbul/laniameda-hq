# Distillation Feedback Log
_Used by agents to improve future distillation quality._
_Format: date | video/source | feedback | what to adjust_

## How This Works

When Michael says "this distillation is off" or "not useful" or gives any negative/corrective feedback:
1. Log it here with context
2. Update the distillation style/lens accordingly
3. Note the pattern so future distillations avoid the same miss
