- Prompt engineering basics → solid intermediate level (knows system prompts, few-shot, chain-of-thought basics)
- OpenClaw setup and basic usage — not a beginner
- Knows how to set up and run agents, basic automation pipelines

## Development
- Can follow code, understands structure; not a deep engineer but capable
- Familiar with modern JS/TS stack

## What to Skip
- Don't explain what an LLM is
- Don't explain what prompt engineering is
- Don't explain basic OpenClaw concepts (agents, sessions, tools)
- Don't explain what a carousel is or basic design fundamentals
- Don't recap things from prior sessions unless he asks
