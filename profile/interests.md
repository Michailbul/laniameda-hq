# Michael's Current Interests & Learning Goals

## Pillar 1: AI Agents & Automation

**Core interest:** Agentic coding + AI automation (OpenClaw, Browser Use, orchestration) — but **not** as generic automation. We frame it through **taste, design, creativity, and philosophy**: systems that ship *and* feel intentional.

### Sub-topics (prioritized):
- **OpenClaw** — how to use it deeply; tutorials, advanced configs, multi-agent orchestration
- **Browser Use / browser automation** — reliable patterns for authenticated workflows (scraping, form flows, content capture)
- **Marketing automation** — automating content creation pipelines, scheduling, repurposing
- **Design automation** — agents that do design tasks; automating carousel creation; Claude Code for design/marketing
- **Vibe coding / delegation** — using agents to write code, delegate dev tasks, multi-agent systems
- **Multi-agent architecture** — how to structure agents that work together (shared KB, handoffs, cron)

### What "useful" looks like for this pillar:
- Concrete workflow or technique I can implement this week
- New OpenClaw / Browser Use feature or pattern I haven't seen
- Real example of an agent replacing a manual workflow I currently do
- Architecture insight (not just theory — actual implementation)
- A way to make automation outputs **higher taste** (better UX, better copy, better design constraints)

## Pillar 2: AI Creatorship

**Core interest:** Everything around being an AI creator — tools, models, philosophy, technique.

### Sub-topics (prioritized):
- **Advanced prompting** — best prompts for specific models (image, video, LLM); techniques beyond basics
- **Model comparisons** — which model wins for which use case (image, video, audio, code)
- **Model updates** — new releases from Midjourney, Runway, Kling, Sora, Flux, Gemini, etc.
- **Video generation workflows** — end-to-end AI video production pipelines
- **AI filmmaking / cinematics** — cinematic AI, AI influencers in this space, aesthetic approaches
- **AI creator philosophy** — what makes a good AI creator; brand building as an AI creator; hiring/team thoughts
- **Image model technique** — prompting for specific aesthetics, lighting, composition

### What "useful" looks like for this pillar:
- Prompt technique or workflow I don't currently use
- Model or tool update that changes my workflow
- Philosophy framing I can use in my own content
- Technique from AI filmmakers/creators I can adapt

---

## Pillar 3: Startups

**Core interest:** General startup knowledge — building, growth, team, founder thinking.

### Sub-topics:
- Early-stage decisions (pre-seed stage relevance)
- Founder sales, growth, distribution
- Team building, hiring, culture
- Product thinking and prioritization

### What "useful" looks like:
- Specific tactic or framework I can apply now
- Mental model shift
- Story from founder at similar stage

## Pillar 4: Art (low frequency)

Rarely updated. Mostly aesthetic inspiration, not learning. Skip unless it's exceptional.

---

## Pillar 5: Advanced OpenClaw Setup & Configuration

**Core interest:** Getting more out of OpenClaw beyond basic usage — advanced configs, patterns, architecture.

### Sub-topics (prioritized):
- **Telegram group setup with agents** — how to properly create and manage groups where agents participate; best practices
- **Advanced OpenClaw configuration** — what settings/patterns most power users set up that beginners miss
- **Multi-agent group architecture** — how agents interact in group chats, channel access control, topic routing
- **OpenClaw best practices** — memory setup, session management, cron patterns, skill organization

### What "useful" looks like:
- Specific config or setting I can apply immediately
- Pattern that unlocks a capability I didn't know existed
- Real example of Telegram group + agent setup that works well

## Second-Order Interest Lens (apply to ALL video evaluations)

**This is important.** Even if a video is NOT directly about Michael's pillars, flag any skills or techniques that are transferable:

- Example: A video about scraping Gmail → Michael doesn't need Gmail scraping, but the scraping technique/skill might apply to scraping X, Discord, or other sources he cares about
- Example: A video about Notion automation → the webhook pattern might be applicable to his content pipeline
- Example: A video about lead gen agents → the browser automation pattern might apply to content scraping

**In every verdict, add a section:**
> **Transferable skills:** [list any techniques/tools/patterns that could be repurposed for Michael's interests, even if the video's main topic is irrelevant]

If no transferable skills → write "None identified."

## Open Questions / Problems I'm Actively Solving

_(Update this as priorities shift)_

- How to build a full content automation pipeline (X/LinkedIn) with agents
- How to make carousel generation fully automated end-to-end
- How to structure a multi-agent system where agents share context but stay scoped
- Best current video generation model for cinematic AI content
- How to properly set up Telegram groups with OpenClaw agents (best practices, advanced config)
