## The Raw Thought

There are two kinds of people in the AI space right now.

**Type 1 — The Builder**
They have Claude Code and they can't stop building. If they need a simple solution like Notion, they won't use it. They'll build their own custom CRM with Convex, real-time sync, and an insane UI. They get thrilled — FOMO, JOMO, whatever it is — when it comes to automating something or creating something for their use case. It doesn't matter that a Google Doc would solve the problem in 5 minutes. They want to build. Cool UI. Great design. Spend two days on it. Business-wise — objectively often nonsense. Drifted attention. Burned tokens. Wasted time.

**Type 2 — The Skeptic**
Always watching this with skepticism. They don't understand Type 1. They criticize vibe coding. "It's not secure." "It doesn't work." "It's not viable." They're not early adopters. More closed-minded. Focused on their work. They see the broken projects and the wasted effort and they think they're right.

## The Defense (That Doesn't Need to Be One)

The skeptics think Type 1 people are chasing results and failing. That's the wrong frame entirely.

Type 1 people don't build because they want the result. **They build because the building is the thing.**

You don't play guitar to make a song. You make a song by playing guitar — enjoying it.
You don't dance because you want to move your body. You dance because something inside you tells you to move with the tempo.

It's not the result. It's the process. The obsession. The state of being consumed by creating something.

For such people — the ones who dream in this form, who get obsessed and inspired to create, be it a web app, a mobile app, an AI video, a code workflow, whatever — **the future belongs to them.**

## The Bigger Point: The Renaissance Era of Creators

We're entering the renaissance era of creators. It's never been a better time to build, create, make art.

The common wisdom says art is dying because AI can reproduce it. That's wrong. What's actually happening is a transformation in the hierarchy of values — people are moving one ladder up.

The new future is behind people who vibe-code stuff for the sake of fun. Who create because they can't not create. **You cannot outplay someone who genuinely enjoys playing.**

The one who wins the infinite game of creating art is the one who does it for fulfillment — and never stops.

## Content Angles

- **The two types** — builder vs skeptic framing (classic two-sides structure, great for engagement)
- **The guitar analogy** — you don't play to make a song / you don't dance to move your body
- **Defense of vibe coding** — not a productivity argument, an art argument
- **The infinite game** — can't outplay someone who enjoys playing
- **Art is not dying** — it's transforming; the hierarchy of values is moving up
- **Renaissance era of creators** — the best time in history to build
- **The obsession is the point** — FOMO builders aren't irrational; they're artists

## Tone Note

This has natural tension in it — two types, a common criticism, a defense that reframes everything. That tension is the hook. Don't flatten it into "both sides are valid." Take the position: Type 1 people are right, and here's the actual reason why.

Direct. Opinionated. Philosophical but grounded in concrete examples (guitar, dance, Claude Code, Notion vs custom CRM).
