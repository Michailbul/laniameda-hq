# Content KB

_Raw material for marketing content. All agents read/write here._

## Structure

```
content-kb/
  raw-voice/     ← Michael's raw thoughts, captured verbatim. Source material for posts/carousels/articles.
  sources/       ← External articles, videos, posts worth referencing (with our take)
  drafts/        ← Work-in-progress content drafts before they go to queue
```

## Rules

- Raw voice files are preserved as-is — don't edit the voice out of them
- Every file gets a date prefix: `YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`
- Meda drafts from here. Michael approves before anything ships.
