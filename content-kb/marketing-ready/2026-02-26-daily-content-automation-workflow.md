## The Idea

Post angle: "How I automated my daily content research with one Claude instruction"

The workflow is a direct example of **Marketing-First + AI Automation** — two of Michael's pillars colliding. It's also highly demonstrable (show the instruction, show the output).

## The Core Workflow (ready to post as-is)

```
Every morning at 8am:
→ Scan: top AI tool drops (ProductHunt, HN, r/StableDiffusion, specific X accounts)
→ Scan: new model releases (Hugging Face trending, Midjourney announcements)
→ Output: 3-5 content ideas, tagged by pillar
→ Saved to ~/work/lania-marketing/content/ideas/YYYY-MM-DD.md
No manual curation. No tab hopping. One instruction.
```

## Post Formats

**X thread (Building in Public / AI Tools pillar):**
- Hook: "I stopped manually curating AI news. Here's the one instruction that replaced it."
- Walk through the scheduled task setup
- Show the markdown output
- CTA: "What sources would you add?"

**Carousel (AI Agents & Automation pillar):**
- "The 5-line AI morning briefing that runs while you sleep"
- Each slide = one step of the workflow

## Notes
- Don't position as Co.Work-specific — make it model/tool agnostic and adaptation-focused
- Emphasize: *you control the sources*. That's the variable that makes it yours.
- Pair with a screenshot of actual output markdown for credibility
