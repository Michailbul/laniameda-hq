# Department: Marketing

_Marketing First is not a slogan. It's how we build._

---

## The Principle

Every product decision has a content angle. Before something gets built, we ask: how does this ship publicly? What's the story? Who cares and why?

Marketing isn't layered on at the end. It's in the spec from day one.

## Owner

**Meda** (marketing CMO agent) — handles content, copy, carousels, social assets, KB ingestion.
**Michael** — approves and publishes all outward-facing content.

## Content Pillars

The seven themes we build content around:

| # | Pillar | What it covers |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Art** | What art is, how to practice it, artistic vision, the compulsion to create — advice for artists, philosophy of making, the renaissance era of AI creation |
| 2 | **AI Creatorship** | Image/video/shot prompts for creators; laniameda.gallery |
| 2 | **Cinematic Frames & Mood Boards** | Pinterest-style prompt + reference library; visual references |
| 3 | **Web Design + AI Design** | Carousels, landing pages, UI via generative AI; design prompts |
| 4 | **Generative AI / AI Tools** | Tool discoveries, model comparisons, workflow breakdowns |
| 5 | **Building in Public** | Founder journey, product decisions, lessons learned |
| 6 | **Marketing-First Product Thinking** | Growth, content repurposing, content engine mechanics |
| 7 | **AI Engineering / LLMs / Agents** | Agentic coding, OpenClaw, Browser Use — told through taste + design |

## Active Channels

- **X (Twitter)** — primary distribution. Personal brand + building in public
- **Telegram** — internal ops channel (`Laniameda-HQ` group)
- Others (Instagram, LinkedIn) — future / TBD

---

## Content Engine

Goal: consistent, high-quality output with minimal manual effort.

**Pipeline:**
1. Source material (videos, articles, notes, prompts, screenshots)
2. AI processing (summarize, extract key insights, classify)
3. Repurpose into platform-native content (tweets, carousels, posts)
4. Review + approve (Michael)
5. Schedule + publish

**Active components:**
- `laniameda.gallery` — prompt vault with 4 pillars (Creators, Cars, Designs, Dump)
- `lania-marketing` repo — marketing workflow infrastructure
- `ai-creator-os` — AI creator OS, UGC content + prompt storage

**Infrastructure in progress:**
- Content automation pipeline (browser scraping → Convex → repurpose → deliver)
- X feed scraping via Parallel AI + Browser Use MCP

## Marketing Campaigns

_Tracked in `knowledge_base/org/pm/backlog.md`_

No formal campaigns launched yet. Phase 1 focus: build brand + audience through consistent content.

---

## Guiding Principles

- Never publish something mediocre with the studio name on it
- Distribution is a product decision, not an afterthought
- Personal brand + studio brand should reinforce each other, not compete
- Every piece of content should have a clear point of view
