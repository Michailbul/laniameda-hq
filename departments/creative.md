## What We Create

### AI Filmmaking & Video
Cinematic sequences, short films, reels. AI-assisted direction, compositing, visual grading. The goal: the emotional impact of film, accessible.

### AI Image Generation
Portrait sessions, product shots, editorial imagery, mood board references. Models used: Nano Banana Pro, CDANCe, Midjourney, FLUX, Gemini, and others.

**Tagging rule:** Every generated image must be tagged with the model used. This is non-negotiable for archival and recall.

### AI-Native Design
- UI and web design — landing pages, carousels, dashboards
- Brand systems and visual identity
- Social media creative assets
- Prompt-driven design workflows

### Prompt Library (laniameda.gallery)
The vault. AI creatorship prompts, cinematic references, web design prompts — organized by pillar:

| Pillar | What it stores |
|---|---|
| **Creators** | AI influencer, fashion, portrait prompts |
| **Cars** | Cinematic automotive references and prompts |
| **Designs** | Website, UI, mobile, component designs |
| **Dump** | Catch-all for useful content that doesn't fit above |

## Creative Standards

- Every output should have a point of view — not just technical competence
- Reference before generating — know the feeling before starting the prompt
- Quality over quantity in the vault — curate, don't just accumulate
- Per-pillar theming in the gallery — Creators (amber/gold), Cars (crimson red), Designs (indigo), Dump (teal)
