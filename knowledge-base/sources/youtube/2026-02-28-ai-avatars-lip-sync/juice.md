# Juice — AI Avatars with Lip Sync (HeyGen Photo-to-Video)

## Workflow (Do Now)

**Step 1 — Generate base image (OpenArt)**
- Use OpenArt photorealistic model
- Prompt structure: front-facing / slight 3/4 view + neutral-to-slight-smile + soft natural lighting + plain background
- Enable "autoenhance" before generating
- Set resolution to widescreen (more horizontal space for animation)
- Example prompt: "front-facing photo of a confident young woman, soft natural lighting, professional photography style, looking directly at camera, plain background"

**Step 2 — HeyGen Photo-to-Video**
- Upload → select voice (filter by language/accent/gender) → paste script → set 1080p
- Key custom motion prompt to add: *"The person looking natural throughout the video, not showing a lot of teeth and not showing hands at all"* — prevents overexpressive avatars

**Step 3 — Generate + Download**
- 1-2 min for short scripts
- Download or use HeyGen's share link for client review
