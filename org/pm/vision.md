# Org Vision — Laniameda Studio

_The north star. Updated when direction shifts. Read by all agents on startup._

---

## Who We Are

Pre-seed AI-native creative studio. We build at the intersection of **art, engineering, and emotional depth**.

Not just creators. Builders — engineers with creative hearts.
We write code and direct films. We design agents and craft visuals.

**Core differentiator:** Most AI studios solve for volume. We solve for **resonance**.
Most AI agencies sell outputs. We build **systems that create lasting value**.

---

## Core Mantras

- **Marketing First** — every product decision has a content angle
- **AI-native** — AI is the instrument, not the shortcut
- **Ship, then refine** — validate fast, compound over time

---

## Stage

**Pre-seed.** Building the foundation: products, brand, systems, audience.

---

## 12-Month Goals

1. **laniameda.gallery** — live, public, used by real AI creators
2. **Audience** — meaningful following on X + LinkedIn around AI creatorship
3. **Revenue signal** — first paying customers or strong inbound interest
4. **Content engine** — consistent output, minimal manual effort
5. **Agent system** — Lani/Meda/Persey running smoothly as an org

---

## What We're NOT Building (Phase 1)

- Generic AI tools for mass market
- High-volume content farms
- Anything that sacrifices taste for speed
