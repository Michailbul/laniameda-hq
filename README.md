# Laniameda HQ

**Ground truth for the Laniameda AI Studio.**

Single source of truth. All agents read from here. Nothing else is canonical.

## Structure

    values.md            ← core values + working principles
    manifesto.md         ← the full positioning statement
    clients.md           ← who we work with (and don't)

  brand/
    visual.md            ← color system, typography, shape, motion, component rules
    voice.md             ← brand voice, tone, vocabulary, what we don't say
    content-standards.md ← content types, quality bar, pillars, what gets killed

    how-we-work.md       ← process, approach, collaboration model
    projects.md          ← all active projects + repos + status

## Agent Startup (mandatory reads)

Every agent reads these on session start:
- `studio/identity.md`
- `studio/vision.md`
- `work/agents.md`

---

## Rules

- This repo wins over any cached agent memory
- Never duplicate info here — one place, one truth
- `content-kb/` grows freely — everything else changes rarely
- Michael approves structural changes to `studio/` and `brand/`
