# Identity

_Who we are at the core._

---

## Name

**Laniameda** (working name). Studio brand in active use.
GitHub org: `laniamedaHQ`

---

## Type

AI-native creative studio — operating at the intersection of art, engineering, and emotional depth.

Not just a creative agency. Not just a dev shop. The boundary between builder and maker doesn't exist here.

---

## Stage

**Pre-seed.** Building the foundation:
- Core products shipped and growing
- Brand + audience being built in public
- First customers being identified
- Agent infrastructure running and evolving

---

## Founder

**Michael** — creator, engineer, founder. Based in Minsk (Europe/Minsk timezone).
- Active on X (Twitter) under personal brand
- Building in public
- Generative AI creator + AI engineer

---

## Origin

Started from a personal creative practice. Evolved into a studio when it became clear the tools, workflows, and systems being built had value beyond one person.

The name, the work, the aesthetic — all of it comes from a genuine obsession with craft, resonance, and building things that feel right.

---

## Core Differentiator

Most AI studios solve for volume. **We solve for resonance.**
Most AI agencies sell outputs. **We build systems that create lasting value.**

AI is the instrument. Craft is the standard. Feeling is the output.

---

## Core Mantras

- **Marketing First** — every product decision has a content angle
- **AI-native** — AI is the instrument, not the shortcut
- **Ship, then refine** — validate fast, compound over time
