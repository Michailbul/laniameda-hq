# Brand Voice & Content Standards

_How we sound. What we say. What we don't._

---

## The Voice

**Direct. Specific. No filler.**

We sound like someone who's actually done the thing — not someone who's read about it. We have opinions. We take positions. We don't qualify everything to death.

**Core attributes:**
- **Specific over generic** — one concrete example beats three vague bullet points
- **One idea per piece** — no compressing five insights into one post
- **Art + engineering + philosophy** — not "AI automation tips"
- **Taste-driven** — we solve for resonance, not reach
- **Earned confidence** — not hype, not humility. Just clarity.

## Tone by Surface

| Surface | Tone |
|---|---|
| X (Twitter) | Direct, sharp, opinionated. Max one idea. Hook first. |
| LinkedIn | Narrative + lesson + one actionable takeaway. Slightly more formal. |
| Instagram carousels | Visual-first, editorial. Text is concise, deliberate. |
| Internal docs | Clear, practical, no filler. Written for agents who need to act. |
| Client-facing | Confident and specific. Never salesy. Let the work speak. |

## What Good Content Looks Like

**For posts:**
- Starts with a strong hook — a tension, a question, a concrete observation
- One idea, developed properly
- Specific: numbers, examples, before/after, real situations
- Ends with either an action or a perspective — not a generic CTA

**For carousels:**
- 7–9 slides maximum
- Each slide = one beat, one clear idea
- Visual-first: text is lean, type is big, breathing room is intentional
- Hook slide carries the entire weight — if it doesn't land, nothing does

**For copy:**
- No sentence that exists only to transition to the next sentence
- No "In conclusion..." / "In today's world..." / "As we all know..."
- No corporate softening: "We strive to..." / "We are dedicated to..."

## What We Post About

Aligned to our 7 content pillars:

1. **AI Creatorship** — how to actually make great AI images/video; prompts, models, workflows
2. **Cinematic Frames & Mood Boards** — reference aesthetics, visual inspiration, prompt breakdown
3. **Web Design + AI Design** — UI/design insights, generative design workflows
4. **Generative AI / AI Tools** — model comparisons, tool discoveries, honest assessments
5. **Building in Public** — real decisions, real mistakes, real progress
6. **Marketing-First Thinking** — how we think about distribution, audience, content engines
7. **AI Engineering / LLMs / Agents** — agentic systems, OpenClaw, automation — told with taste

## What We Don't Post About

**Content we actively avoid:**

❌ **Generic AI hype** — "AI is changing everything!" with no specifics  
❌ **Listicles that anyone could write** — "10 AI tools you need to try"  
❌ **Low-quality automation output** — posts that smell like they were batch-generated  
❌ **Slow-production, low-effort content** — if it didn't require taste or judgment, we don't ship it  
❌ **Engagement bait** — "Do you agree? Comment below 👇"  
❌ **Fake authenticity** — "Honest thoughts from a founder..." followed by nothing honest  
❌ **Surface-level tool reviews** — we go deep or we don't go  
❌ **Content that contradicts the aesthetic** — if it looks cheap, it doesn't go out  

---

## The Quality Bar

**Before anything goes out, ask:**
1. Would we be proud to have this attached to the studio name?
2. Is there one specific, concrete thing here that someone couldn't find elsewhere?
3. Does it reflect our aesthetic — dark, editorial, considered?
4. Did a human with taste touch this, or did it just get generated and queued?

If any answer is no — rewrite or kill it.

## Brand Voice Rules for Agents

When Meda drafts content:
- Never use: "I'm excited to share...", "At [Studio Name] we believe...", "Join us on this journey"
- Never write five bullet points when two would do
- Never hedge an opinion — take the position
- Use the content pillar filter: does this serve one of the 7 pillars? If not, rethink
- Always: specific example, concrete outcome, clear point of view

---

## Vocabulary We Own

Phrases that carry our positioning:

- "Art + engineering + emotional depth"
- "Taste-driven"
- "Resonance over reach"
- "AI as instrument, not shortcut"
- "Marketing First"
- "Ship, then refine"
- "Systems that create lasting value"

Don't overuse. Use when earned.
