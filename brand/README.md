## The Short Version

**Visual:** Dark. Warm-dark (amber/orange accents, brown-black backgrounds). Cinematic. Editorial. Pill shapes. Subtle motion. No cold neon.

**Voice:** Direct. Specific. One idea per piece. Art + engineering + philosophy. Resonance over reach.

**Content:** Taste-driven or not at all. Maps to one of 7 pillars. Passes the quality bar. Michael approves before it ships.
