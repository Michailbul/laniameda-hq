# Who We Work With

_The right clients. And the ones who aren't._

## Who We Work With

We work with people who refuse to settle — clients for whom quality isn't a preference, it's a non-negotiable.

### Artists and Musicians
Who need visuals with a soul, not a template. Who want their aesthetic extended into the AI era without losing what makes it theirs.

### Brands With a Point of View
Building culture, not just awareness. Brands that have something to say and need the production quality to say it convincingly.

### Film and Animation Studios
Who see AI as a creative amplifier, not a cost-cutter. Who want to do more — not just cheaper.

### Founders and Startups
Who need to move fast without looking cheap. Who understand that how you show up is part of the product.

### SMM and Marketing Agencies
Who want to offer AI-powered creative to their clients without building the infrastructure themselves.

### Coaches and Creators
Who understand that how you show up online is the product. Personal brand as business.

## Who We Don't Work With

- Clients who want to churn output without caring about quality
- Brands with no distinct point of view who want AI to invent one for them
- Anyone who sees AI as a way to avoid creative thought entirely
- Clients who can't define what "good" looks like to them

## The Filter

If they don't care about craft, they're not our client.
If they want volume over resonance, they're not our client.
If they're looking for the cheapest option, they're not our client.

We'd rather have fewer of the right clients than many of the wrong ones.
