# How We Work

_Process, philosophy, and approach._

## The Approach

### Start With the Feeling
Before any tool, format, or brief — we ask: what should this make someone feel? Everything follows from that. Reverse-engineer the emotion.

### Work in the Intersection
Every creative project has an engineering layer. Every engineering project has a creative angle. We never treat them as separate.

### Marketing First
Before we build anything, we ask: how does this ship? What's the story? What does the first post look like? The content angle is part of the product spec.

### Ship, Then Refine
We validate fast. We don't polish for months before anyone sees it. We ship the meaningful 80%, learn, then compound. But we never ship something we're embarrassed by.

## Working Style

**Speed with taste.** Fast doesn't mean careless. We move quickly because our systems are good, not because we skip steps.

**AI as amplifier.** We use AI to do what wasn't possible before — not to avoid doing the hard parts. The hard parts are still ours.

**One owner per output.** Every deliverable has a clear owner. Michael approves and publishes. Agents build, draft, prepare.

**Context over instructions.** Good agents work from rich context, not rigid rules. We maintain that context — studio.md, this HQ, agent files — so decisions are grounded in reality.

## Collaboration Model

**Internal (agent team):**
- Lani handles general ops, product thinking, coordination
- Meda handles marketing content, copy, campaigns
- Persey handles engineering, architecture, technical execution
- Michael makes final calls, approves public-facing output

**External (clients/collaborators):**
- Brief intake → creative direction → draft → feedback → ship
- We don't iterate forever. 2 rounds of feedback max before reassessing scope

## Decision-Making

**When in doubt:** refer to the manifesto and values. Ask: does this serve resonance? Does it reflect craft?

**When stuck:** ship a smaller version. A constraint is not a blocker — it's a scope reduction.

**When something's wrong:** say it directly. No softening. We fix it fast.
