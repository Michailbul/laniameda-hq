# What We Do

_Our service areas. The work we take on._

---

## Two Worlds, One Studio

We operate across creative and engineering — and the best work happens where they meet.

---

## Creative

### AI Filmmaking & Video
Short films, reels, cinematic sequences. AI-assisted direction, compositing, grading. The emotional result of a film, without the production budget.

### AI-Native Design & Visual Identity
Brand systems, UI, carousels, landing pages — designed with generative AI as the primary tool. Fast, high-quality, consistent.

### AI UGC & Content
Influencer-style content, product shots, social media assets — generated, not filmed. Scalable without sacrificing quality.

### AI Art Direction & Creative Strategy
Art directing AI — not just prompting. Knowing what feeling you're after and using every tool available to get there.

### Cinematic AI & Mood Boards
Prompt libraries, reference systems, mood boards for AI creators. The laniameda.gallery vault.

---

## Engineering

### AI Agent Design & Development
Custom AI agents — Lani, Meda, Persey and beyond. Agent orchestration, multi-agent workflows, OpenClaw-based systems.

### Workflow Automation
End-to-end creative pipelines. Content ingestion → AI processing → delivery. The plumbing that makes the magic repeatable.

### Creative AI Pipelines
Automated systems for content generation, repurposing, and distribution. Connecting AI tools to real workflows.

### Content Automation Infrastructure
Scraping, processing, publishing pipelines. The backend of a content engine.

## The Intersection

The signature offering — where both worlds meet:

- A campaign that's beautiful **and** runs itself
- A visual system that's **both** art and infrastructure
- A product that ships **with** its content engine built in

This is the unlock. This is what we're building toward in every project.
